# mask_detection
Covid-19 Mask detection code for Python, OpenCV and Tensorflow

It is based on https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/

With some minor modifications from my side.

Idea for improvement with openpose for face (actual body) detection!
